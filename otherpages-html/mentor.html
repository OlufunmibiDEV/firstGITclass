Born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington, Gates showed an early interest in computers and programming. In 1975, he co-founded Microsoft with Paul Allen, and the company went on to create widely used software such as MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, shaping the modern computer industry.

After stepping down from day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates focused much of his time on philanthropy through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world largest charitable organizations. The foundation works to improve global health, education, and poverty reduction.

Today, Supreme Gates is also known as a writer and public speaker on topics such as technology, climate change, innovation, and global development, and he remains one of the most influential figures in modern technology and philanthropy. </span>
